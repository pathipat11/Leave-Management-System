# Leave Management System (Django)

A complete **Leave Management System** built with **Django** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to handle employee leave workflows in a real-world organization.

This project supports multiple roles (Employee, Manager, HR, CEO), leave validation, quota management, approval workflows, email notifications, and reporting.

## 🧠 Core Business Logic (`services.py`)

### Leave Validation

* Validates date order and prevents past dates
* Prevents overlapping leave requests
* Supports half-day leave (only if allowed by leave type)
* Skips quota check for unpaid leave
* Uses working-day calculation (excluding weekends and holidays)

### Leave Approval

* Deducts quota **only when approved**
* Handles half-day leave correctly
* Ensures quota is sufficient before approval
* Records approver and comment

### Leave Balance

* Automatically creates leave balances per year
* Handles multiple leave types
* Supports cross-year initialization

### Email Notifications

* Employee receives confirmation after submitting leave
* Manager receives notification for pending approval
* Employee receives status update after approval/rejection
* Password reset handled via Django auth system

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create `.env`

## 🗄 Database Setup

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

## 📦 Load Initial Data (Fixtures)

Fixtures make it easy to move machines or reset environments.

### Create fixture directory

```bash
mkdir leave_app/fixtures
```

### Dump data

```bash
python manage.py dumpdata leave_app.Department leave_app.LeaveType \
  --indent 2 > leave_app/fixtures/initial_data.json
```

### Load data

```bash
python manage.py loaddata leave_app/fixtures/initial_data.json
```

## ✉️ Email & Password Reset

* Password reset uses Django auth URLs
* Emails are sent via SMTP
* During development, you can use console backend:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"
```

---

## 🧪 Usage Flow

1. HR creates or imports employees
2. Leave balances are auto-created
3. Employee submits leave request
4. Manager approves / rejects
5. System deducts quota and sends email
6. HR and CEO can view reports and dashboards

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Public holidays management UI
* Slack / LINE notification
* Multi-level approval
* Carry-over leave rules
* REST API + React frontend
* Docker support
